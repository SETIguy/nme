## IF YOU DO NOT ATTACH kbd0 at zs1 channel A, THEN YOU MUST ATTACH
## sink0 at zs1 channel A, otherwise the PROM's keyboard poll never
## finishes:
##
sink0 at zs1 channel A: tme/serial/sink

## ttya:
##
# comment the first line, and uncomment the following line if you
# aren't using the graphics-based display console.  this will connect ttya
# to the master side of a pseudo-tty (in this case, /dev/ttyr0), which
# you can connect to using tip or some other serial communications
# program on the slave side (in this case, /dev/ptyr0):
#
#console0 at zs0 channel A: tme/host/posix/serial device /dev/ttyr0 break-carats
# OR enable POSIX pseudo-terminal master (if available) using the ptmx clone device:
# the tmesh console will display the slave device to connect to (e.g., /dev/pts/3)
